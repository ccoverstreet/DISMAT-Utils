# CCO Srim Utility

Moved to own repository at [CCOSRIMUtil](https://github.com/ccoverstreet/CCOSRIMUtil)

This utility is used to convert the output of SRIM into an energy loss vs. depth format with sensible units.

## GUI Mode

- The ccosrimutil now can be run in a GUI mode (PyQt6 + Matplotlib) by not providing any command line arguments (`python ccosrimutil_gui.py`)
